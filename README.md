:sparkle: View the [official Hextory public roadmap](https://github.com/users/HextoryWorld/projects/2/views/6)

The Hextory roadmap is where you can learn about what features i am working on, what stage they're in, and when i expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [GitHub feedback discussions](https://github.com/HextoryWorld/HextoryPublicRoadmap/discussions).

The roadmap repository is for communicating Hextoryâ€™s roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and i'll lock conversations. Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from Hextory developer. Any feedback has to be send to the discussions tab.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or tool to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **documentation:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **prototype:** *Primarily for internal testing and feedback*\
Limited availability. First developed version of the feature. Unstable, unpolished and quick changes to test playability. 

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback by patrons*\
Limited availability. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change.

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented.

- **release version:** *Generally available to all players*\
Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every tool or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.
